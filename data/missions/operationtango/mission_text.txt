During the second AI war, Hegemony did not take autonomous fleet seriously, not until Operation Tango.

Operation Tango was nothing special, so as Admiral Seinichi thought. Their recon ship discovered a system infested with autonomous nexus a week ago and they decided to root it out before it's well established.

As soon as they engaged the nexus, they got a terrible surprise: it was an ambush. Tri-Tachyon deployed Special Task Force 58 to guard the autonomous nexus until it's fully operational. The entire task force was docked in the nexus, waiting for the visitors.

There is no turning back.
